        <h4>a few details</h4><br/>  
    
        <p>In an attempt to be unnecessarily modest I shall take my time in making a proper About page. Meanwhile, please enjoy the following diatribe:<br/><br/>
        
        I am a human male. Assumed to have basic intelligence, still confirming. Went to several schools, being an Army kid. Didn't do too bad in 10th and 12th (not that you care).<br/><br/>
            
        Graduated from SPA (School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi) in 2013.<br/><br/>
            
        Worked at Abaxial Architects Pvt. Ltd. as a Junior Architect for about 20 months and Firki Studio for about 6 months, followed by a brief 6 month stint as a freelance Architectural photographer.<br/><br/>
            
        From Photography, I drifted towards Graphic Design - working for a year at Whitespace35 in Bangalore, before joining NID Bangalore for a post-graduate programme in Information Design.<br/><br/>

        Interested in Illustration, Architecture, Design and Photography among other interests such as breathing, seeing, drinking, eating, music, movies, dreaming and pointless philosophising.</p><br/>

        <p>Thank You</p><br/>
 
        <p>Regards,</p><br/>
